ming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does something and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program.



python 31 key words:

as        elif      global    or        with     
assert    else      if        pass      yield    
break     except    import    print

Statement  Expression  operator  variable
Technically an expression is also a statement, but it is probably simpler to think of them as different things. The important difference is that an expression has a value; a statement does not.

what you should remind yourself is deploy!!!! arrange


PEMDAS
When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules:

    Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, 2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn’t change the result.
    Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 2**1+1 is 3, not 4, and 3*1**3 is 3, not 27.
    Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So 2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5.
    Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation). So in the expression degrees / 2 * pi, the division happens first and the result is multiplied by pi. To divide by 2 π, you can use parentheses or write degrees / 2 / pi.


String operation
The + operator works with strings, but it might not do what you expect: it performs concatenation, which means joining the strings by linking them end-to-end


int can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn’t round off; it chops off the fraction part:
------so round() can round off!
>>> int(3.99999)
3
>>> int(-2.3)
-2

-----------------------------这个很是特殊啊！-

You can also use a variable as an argument:

>>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'
>>> print_twice(michael)
Eric, the half a bee.
Eric, the half a bee.

Each function is represented by a frame. A frame is a box with the name of a function beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it.
