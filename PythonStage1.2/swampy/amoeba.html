<h1>AmoebaWorld</h1>

AmoebaWorld is used in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080110204417/http://allendowney.com/ip04/">Introductory Programming</a> to
provide practice writing Python expressions and to introduce
object-oriented programming.

Here is the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080110204417/http://allendowney.com/ip04/hw02/hw02.html">first
homework</a> that uses AmeobaWorld.  Students write Python expressions
that evaluate parametric equations.  The Amoeba traces the resulting
curves.  Here is an example showing the "slide", an Amoeba, and the
control panel where students type expressions.

In a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080110204417/http://allendowney.com/ip04/hw10/hw10.html">later
homework</a>, students write functions that allow the Amoebas to move
toward each other, detect collisions, mate, and produce baby Amoebas.

</p><p>
Here is what a solution might look like after 200 steps:

</p><p>

</p><p>
In this case there is no control panel, since the students are
writing a program to control the Amoebas, rather than using the GUI.
Here is some of the code from the solution:

</p><p>
</p><pre>def main(n=200):
    world = AmoebaWorld()

    # make the Amoebas
    amy = make_amoeba(world, 'amy', 'pink')
    bob = make_amoeba(world, 'bob', 'light blue')
    pat = make_amoeba(world, 'pat', 'chartreuse')

    amy.crush = bob
    bob.crush = pat
    pat.crush = amy
    
    # run the loop n times
    for i in range(n):

        # move the amoebas
        for amoeba in world.animals:
            move(amoeba)
            nudge(amoeba, amoeba.crush)
            check_collisions(amoeba, world)

        # update the world and wait 0.1 seconds
        world.update()
        time.sleep(0.1)

    # wait for the user to close the window
    world.mainloop()

# after all the function definitions, call main
main()
</pre>

<p>
This example uses some object-oriented features, but it is mostly
written in a procedural style.  Introductory Programming focuses
on basic programming skills and defers object-oriented design until
Software Design.
