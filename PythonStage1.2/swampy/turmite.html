<h1>TurmiteWorld</h1>

TurmiteWorld is used in <a
href="http://ece.olin.edu/cm/cm-wiki.cgi">Computational Modeling</a> to
demonstrate cellular automata
and finite state machines, including <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LangtonsAnt.html">Langton's
Ant</a>.  (The misspelling of "termite" is deliberate; it is a tribute
to Alan Turing).

<p>
In one of the <a
href="http://ece.olin.edu/cm/cm-wiki.cgi/HomeworkTen">homeworks</a>,
students are asked to implement the cellular automaton of their
choice, starting with some sources for examples.
Some of the results (with brief descriptions) are available 
<a href="http://ece.olin.edu/cm/cm-wiki.cgi/HomeWork10Dropbox">here</a>.

<p>
TurmiteWorld is an implementation of Langton's Ant, a four-state
turing machine that "lives" on a 2-dimensional, 2-state "tape".
During each time step, Langton's Ant follows this program:

<ul>

<li>If the current cell is yellow, turn right.  Otherwise turn left.

<li>Toggle the current cell (black becomes yellow and vice versa).

<li>Move forward one cell.

</ul>

<p>
Since the rules are simple and the world is simple, we expect
the behavior of the system to be simple, but surprisingly Langton's
Ant follows a complex and unpredictable path for more than 10 000
steps.  After that, the ant repeats a sequence of 104 steps, each
time shifting by one cell toward the upper left corner.  The
resulting structure is called the "highway".

<p>
The following screenshot shows the state of the system
shortly after the ant finds the highway.
The ant is the red triangle in the upper left.

<p>
The program in the "run this code" entry demonstrates a more
complicated pattern starting with three Turmites facing in
different directions.  

<p>
Here is the code that implements Langton's
rules:

<pre>
    def step(self):
        if self.is_on_mark():
            self.lt()
        else:
            self.rt()
        self.toggle()
        self.fd()
</pre>

Turmite methods are similar to Turtle methods: <tt>lt</tt> stands
for left turn, <tt>rt</tt> is right turn, and <tt>fd</tt> is forward.

<p>
One of the features provided by the World class is coordinate
transformation.  The most useful transformation is called
CanvasTransform, which converts from standard Cartesian coordinates
(origin in the middle, positive y axis up) to the graphics coordinates
used by Tkinter (origin in the upper left, y axis down).  As
a just-for-fun example, it also provides SwirlTransform, which
is a simple example of a nonlinear map.

<p>
Here is what the three-ant example looks like under a SwirlTransform:

<p>

<p>
In this case one of the Turmites finds the highway, but a second
Turmite chases him down, and their interaction put the first Turmite
in reverse, consuming the highway it just built (in the lower left).
These two fall into a repeating pattern, building and destroying the
highway.  Meanwhile, in the upper left, the third Turmite makes his escape.

<p>
To paraphrase <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Wolfram</a>,
simple rules can yield a surprising amount of drama.
