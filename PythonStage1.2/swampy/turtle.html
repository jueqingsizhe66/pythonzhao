<h1>TurtleWorld</h1>

TurtleWorld is used for about half of the modules in <a
href="http://allendowney.com/ip04/">Software Design</a>.  It is based
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Logo-like
turtle graphics</a>.

<p>
In the <a href="http://allendowney.com/sd06spr/hw01/hw01.html">first assignment</a>,
students write functions to draw letters of the alphabet.  The
objective is for students to identify a set of primitive elements that
can be combined to form letters, then implement the primitives as 
functions.

<p>
In the partial solution below, the turtle only knows the letters
"acefhlnmo".  In a 
<a href="http://allendowney.com/sd06spr/hw03/hw03.html">later assignment</a>, 
students write filters that search a dictionary for words that use
only certain letters.  Here are the longest words this turtle can
type:

<p>
So in the first assignment, students see one of the important ideas in
the class: multilevel interface design; that is, design that is based
on a set of primitives that are used to implement intermediate
functions, which are used to implement higher-level functions, and so
on.

<p>
The <a href="http://allendowney.com/sd06spr/hw02/hw02.html">next assignment</a>
builds on this idea, introducing generalization (adding parameters to
make functions more general) and overgeneralization (writing a very
general function and then writing helper functions that provide
simpler interfaces to the overgeneralized function).

<p>
In a <a href="http://allendowney.com/sd06spr/hw06/hw06.html">later homework</a>,
students teach the turtles to play tag:

<p>

<p>
This assignment and the <a href="">next</a> demonstrate two ways
of managing concurrent agents:

<ul>

<li>In Taggers.py, the World object invokes Turtle.step on each
Turtle, once per time step.

<p>
<li>In Threaders.py, each Turtle is controlled by a Thread.

</ul>

<p>
After using TurtleWorld for a few weeks, students start to read the
code they have been working with.  In <a
href="http://allendowney.com/sd06spr/hw09/hw09.html">this exercise</a> students
write subclasses that inherit from Turtle and TurtleWorld, then add
new features to both.  This example motivates the use of inheritance
to extend library code without modifying it.  It is also
a gentle introduction to event-driven (GUI-based) programming.

<p>
Here is part of a solution to this exercise:

<p>
<pre>
class MyWorld(TurtleWorld):
    def setup(self):

        # canvas width and height
        self.ca_width = 400
        self.ca_height = 400

        # make the canvas
        self.canvas = self.ca(width=self.ca_width, 
                              height=self.ca_height,
                              bg='white')

        # make the buttons
        self.fr(LEFT, fill=BOTH, expand=1)

        self.bu(LEFT, text='Draw circle', command=self.circle)
        self.bu(LEFT, text='Quit', command=self.quit)

        self.endfr()

    def circle(self):
        """this callback is invoked when the user presses 
        Draw Circle"""
        ca = self.canvas
        ca.circle(0, 0, 100, fill='red')
</pre>

These exercises follow the order of presentation
in <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/"><i>How to Think
Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python</i></a>, which was
